# Next.js 13 (App router) Mastery Training Project

This is my personal training project, where I am honing my skills in **Next.js 13**, the latest version of the powerful React framework. I am utilizing **Tailwind CSS** for efficient and scalable design, and integrating **Grafbase** as a versatile backend. This project is inspired by **JavaScript Mastery**, one of the best web development courses available online, known for its comprehensive and clear teaching style.

Through this project, I am diving deep into the capabilities of these technologies, striving to achieve a high level of proficiency and to create a robust, modern, and responsive web application.

ðŸŒŸ Special thanks to **JavaScript Mastery** for being a constant source of inspiration and learning in my web development journey.
